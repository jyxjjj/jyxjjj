# Self Used User Configuration Files

this is a branch but actually a repository that can be aliased as `DOT Files`.

# Installation

This is a simple way to install the configuration files.

But it has not been tested.

```zsh
/bin/zsh -i -l -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyxjjj/jyxjjj/UserConfigs/install.sh)"
```

# Warning

Installation is not reversible, it will overwrite your existing configuration files.

And it is not as same as this repository, it has some reduce.

You can directly read the `install.sh` script and copy some of the configurations you need.
